      "question": "The side effects mention 'mild tingling for sensitive skin'. Is this a sign of an allergic reaction, and should I be concerned about it causing redness or irritation?",
      "answer": "A mild tingling sensation can be a normal reaction as your skin adjusts to the potent Vitamin C. We strongly recommend performing a patch test first. If the tingling is severe, lasts more than a few minutes, or is accompanied by significant redness or burning, you should discontinue use."

      "question": "How should I incorporate this into my existing skincare routine? Should I use it in the morning or at night, and before or after my moisturizer?",
      "answer": "For optimal results, apply 3-4 drops to clean, dry skin once daily in the morning. This allows the serum's antioxidant properties to protect your skin from environmental damage during the day. Always follow it with your moisturizer and a broad-spectrum sunscreen."

      "question": "At a price of 699.0, what specific results justify the cost, and how long will one bottle typically last with daily use?",
      "answer": "The price reflects a high-concentration formula designed to visibly brighten skin, reduce the appearance of dark spots, and improve overall texture. With the recommended daily application, one bottle is formulated to last approximately 2-3 months, making it a lasting investment in your skin's health."

      "question": "I've heard Vitamin C serums can oxidize and change color. How will I know if the product has gone bad, and is it still safe to use if the color changes?",
      "answer": "A slight change to a light yellow or champagne color is normal. However, if the serum turns dark orange or brown, it has oxidized and lost its effectiveness. It is not harmful, but we recommend replacing it to ensure you get the full benefits. Store it in a cool, dark place to prolong its shelf life."

      "question": "How soon can I realistically expect to see a noticeable improvement in my skin's brightness and tone after starting to use GlowBoost?",
      "answer": "While some users report an initial 'glow' within the first week, visible improvements in skin tone and the fading of dark spots typically require consistent daily use for at least 4-6 weeks. Results vary based on skin type and condition, so consistency is key."
