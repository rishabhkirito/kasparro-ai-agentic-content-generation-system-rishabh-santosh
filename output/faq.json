      "question": "Is GlowBoost Vitamin C Serum safe for all skin types?",
      "answer": "Yes, GlowBoost is formulated to be safe for all skin types, including oily, dry, combination, and normal skin. However, individuals with very sensitive skin might experience a mild tingling sensation upon initial applications. This is typically normal as the skin adjusts. We recommend performing a patch test on a small area before your first full application."

      "category": "Safety",
      "question": "Are there any side effects I should be aware of?",
      "answer": "The most common feedback from users with sensitive skin is a mild, temporary tingling sensation. This is a normal reaction to the active Vitamin C and usually subsides as your skin acclimates. If you experience persistent irritation or redness, please discontinue use and consult a dermatologist."

      "question": "How do I incorporate GlowBoost into my skincare routine?",
      "answer": "For best results, use GlowBoost in the morning. After cleansing and toning, apply 3-4 drops to your dry face and neck. Gently pat it into the skin. Allow it to fully absorb before following with your moisturizer and a broad-spectrum sunscreen."

      "category": "Usage",
      "question": "How often should I use the serum?",
      "answer": "We recommend using GlowBoost once daily, in the morning. This allows you to take full advantage of its antioxidant properties that help protect your skin from environmental stressors like UV rays and pollution throughout the day."
    },
    {
      "category": "Usage",
      "question": "Can I use GlowBoost with other active ingredients like Retinol or AHAs?",
      "answer": "Yes, but it's best to alternate their use. We suggest using GlowBoost (Vitamin C) in your morning routine and other actives like Retinol or exfoliating acids (AHAs/BHAs) in your evening routine. Using them at different times of day minimizes the risk of irritation."

    {
      "category": "Usage",
      "question": "Do I really need to wear sunscreen when using this serum?",
      "answer": "Yes, this is a critical step! Vitamin C provides antioxidant protection but can also make your skin more sensitive to the sun. Using a broad-spectrum SPF 30 or higher every day is essential to protect your skin, prevent sun damage, and maximize the serum's benefits."

      "category": "Science",
      "question": "What is the percentage of Vitamin C in the serum?",

    {
      "category": "Science",
      "question": "How does Vitamin C help with dark spots?",
      "answer": "Vitamin C inhibits the enzyme tyrosinase, which is responsible for melanin production in the skin. By regulating pigment production, it helps to fade existing dark spots and prevent new ones from forming, leading to a more even complexion."
    },
    {
      "category": "Science",
      "question": "My serum has changed to a light yellow color. Is it still okay to use?",
      "answer": "Yes. It is normal for a potent L-Ascorbic Acid serum to oxidize slightly and turn a pale yellow color over time. It is still safe and effective to use. However, if the serum turns dark orange or brown, it has oxidized significantly, lost its potency, and should be replaced."
